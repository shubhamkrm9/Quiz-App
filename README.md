This is a basic Quiz app made using HTML CSS and Javascript.
In this webpage I am using an API to fetch all the questions its options and its correct answers 
And based on that i am calculating scores as per user innput 
It is not fully functionable till now as right now only questions of same category will be showed with the same difficulty(set as medium) no matter which button you are clicking on index.html page
Overtime as I learn new thing I will make sure that I will make it more functionable and better with more new features
